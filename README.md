## What is this project
This is the java implementation of the book [Raytracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) . We will start with a basic java implementation where we do not care about object creation and will try to adhere to java ways of returning the objects instead of output arguments, but as we will move towards optimising the code, we may move away from that style.
